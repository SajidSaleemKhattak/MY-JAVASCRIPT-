        but if we want to use the return value of a function like for further operations (+,-,/,*) or comparisons
        (>,<,===) or in conditionals etc then we definitely need to store that value of a function in another variable

            expression function you first have to create it and then call it , while declarative function are not
            ristristed to be first declared). It is because of the concept of HOISTING IN JAVASCRIPT.....! e.g */ let

            store the return value of a function directly into a variable but in expression function we have to use the

            CODE
            because the arrow function automatically returns the the value obtained as a result of the code after the

        Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
        gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
        Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
        one average score per team).
        A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
        Otherwise, no team wins!
        Your tasks:
        1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
        2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
        3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
        as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
        to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
        Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
        4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
        Data 2
        5. Ignore draws this time
        Test data:
        ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
        ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
    </p>
